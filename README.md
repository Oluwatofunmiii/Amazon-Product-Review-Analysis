# Amazon-Product-Review-Analysis
This project dissects a scraped Amazon dataset with the aim to uncover how price, discount, ratings, and review interact across product category. It is a Microsoft Excel- focused analysis, where I used my skills to distil raw e-commerce data, cleaning and refining it into actionable insights for marketing teams.
