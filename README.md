# Amazon-Product-Review-Analysis
This project dissects a scraped Amazon dataset with the aim to uncover how price, discount, ratings, and review interact across product category. It is a Microsoft Excel- focused analysis, where I used my skills to distil raw e-commerce data, cleaning and refining it into actionable insights for marketing teams. 
## Objectives
- Quantify pricing and discount patterns by product category.
- Identify products and categories with the strongest review engagemen.
- Assess relationships between discount levels and customer ratings.
- To generate insight on the product flow and revenue sustainance.
- Deliver a concise, interactive Excel dashboard for non-technical stakeholders.
## Data Overview
- 1,465 rows containing one row per product.
- 16 columns (product name, category, discounted price, discount %, average rating, reviews and more).
- I removed long text columns that were not needed.
- I made sure numbers are stored as numbers and percentages as percentages.
## Steps I Followed
#### Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. Removed irrelevant text fields
2. Standardized Column Names (`Discount %`)
3. Converted Data types - Prices to Numeric, Discount to Percentages
4. Split Nested Categories - Ranked and Kept highest-level segment
5. Created Calculated Columns (`Revenue`, `Price Range Bucket`)
#### Create Pivot Tables
To analyse business questions and compare values (`average discount by category`)
#### Build the dashboard
Bar charts for category comparisons. Pie and Bar charts for business insights into highest discount % by regions.
