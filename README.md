# Amazon-Product-Review-Analysis
This project dissects a scraped Amazon dataset with the aim to uncover how price, discount, ratings, and review interact across product category. It is a Microsoft Excel- focused analysis, where I used my skills to distil raw e-commerce data, cleaning and refining it into actionable insights for marketing teams. 
## Objectives
- Quantify pricing and discount patterns by product category.
- Identify products and categories with the strongest review engagemen.
- Assess relationships between discount levels and customer ratings.
- To generate insight on the product flow and revenue sustainance.
- Deliver a concise, interactive Excel dashboard for non-technical stakeholders.
